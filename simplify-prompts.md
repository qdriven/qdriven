# Prompts

I want to simplify my profiles. What to simplify:
- Overall, one sentence to claim I am a self-taught developer from manual testing to a full-stack developer.
- Things I am good at are not only qa team management,productivity tools development,and automation testing,but also full-stack coding skills, and collaboration with cross-functional teams, continues learning and problem-solving.
- the personal projects in github is for sharing, learning and practicing my skills. currently working on how to use AI to revisited almost everything I have experienced.

which will incude some project like: ai daily apps, build new QA productivity tools, small biz solutions and self used personal infracture, and frameworks.
